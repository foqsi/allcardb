The intention of this project is to display front-end/UI skills. 
The user will select the make, model, year, & trim of a vehicle. The information for that vehicle will be displayed along with a photo.
It will likely utilize a database that I have created myself, unless I find one that has the data that I want.


This is just a side project I am working on. I expand on it as I learn. I started out with just basic HTML and CSS. 
When I learned JS, I decided to take a new approach utilizing JS.

While learning React, I want to convert it to a React app.
